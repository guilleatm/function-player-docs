# Function Player Documentation

This is the official documentation for the [Function Player](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/function-player-329120) Unity package, a powerful Unity Editor tool that bridges the gap between code and editor by enabling you to call component methods from the inspector.

## What is Function Player?

Function Player lets you execute almost any method from any component directly in the Unity Editor. Pass arguments (including primitive types and most Unity objects), run coroutines that can pause execution until conditions are met, and even manipulate built-in Unity properties like Transform.position via setters.

Instead of hardcoding sequences of events in a script, you can design and trigger them interactively—waiting for user input, a timed delay, or in-game events—directly from the Inspector.

## Key Features

- Method Execution: Call component methods directly from the Unity Inspector
- Parameter Support: Pass arguments including primitive types and Unity objects
- Coroutine Support: Run coroutines with conditional pauses and delays
- Property Manipulation: Modify built-in Unity properties via setters
- Interactive Design: Create event sequences without hardcoding
