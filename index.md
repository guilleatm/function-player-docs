# Function Player Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for **Function Player**, a powerful Unity Editor tool that bridges the gap between code and editor by enabling you to call component methods instantly from the Unity Inspector.

## What is Function Player?

Function Player lets you execute almost any method from any component directly in the Unity Editor. Pass arguments (including primitive types and most Unity objects), run coroutines that can pause execution until conditions are met, and even manipulate built-in Unity properties like Transform.position via setters.

Instead of hardcoding sequences of events in a script, you can design and trigger them interactively—waiting for user input, a timed delay, or in-game events—directly from the Inspector.
